tabbed image gallery
To create an image gallery based off a link the user clicks. As one link is clicked, the previous gallery disappears, and the new image gallery appears.

NOTE: This app is buggy - its not working 100%. The only link that works is "image 1" - However, "image 2" and "image 3", don't display any images
